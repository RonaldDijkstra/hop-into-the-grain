            Electric Hollers stands for a new generation of blues and rock artists from northern Netherlands. Get ready to be blown away by a wall of vintage sound and energy! Heavy bass tones, thundering drums and guitar solos that drag you through past times. The band is inspired by Led Zeppelin, Santana & Ten Years After and released their first album "Rise" in 2018.
