            Electric Hollers stands for a new generation of blues and rock artists from northern Netherlands. Get ready to be blown away by a wall of vintage sound and energy! Heavy bass tones, thundering drums and guitar solos that drag you through past times. The band is inspired by Led Zeppelin, Santana & Ten Years After and released their first album "Rise" in 2018.

            Blues and Beer, a poor man's remedy. Don't get us wrong, this should be a happy day and evening, but a bit of blues is never far away with a good pint in hand. After all, life is a smile and a tear. And is there anything better than a great Chicago Blues band? 10.000 Volt will play classics and own work.

            'Because nothing epic happens drinking water'. These beer-evangelists from Enschede are on a mission to spread the word of good-craft-beer.

            Uncomplicated and yet special. Berging focuses on reinventing traditional flavors and developing sustainable recipes.
        klein-duimpje:
          text: |
            More than 20 years of brewing experience and more than 20 beers to their name, Klein Duimpje is certainly not a small one in craft beer.
        nevel:
          text: |
            Nevel focuses entirely on beers with mixed and wild yeasts. The wild yeasts ensure that the beer becomes refreshing, dry and complex. Nevel brews as much as possible with organic and unprocessed ingredients from their home-town Nijmegen.
        doggerland:

            Doggerland Craft Cider wants to bridge the gap between English cider culture and the surplus of the apple harvest in and around Groningen. They now have 4 ciders in production, each with a pure and quirky taste.
        vandestreek:
          text: |
            The brewing brothers of VandeStreek do not shy away from new tastes and techniques. They now have a core range of 7 beers, supplemented with a special release each month, collaborations with other hop fanatics and barrel bged beers from their fast-growing barrel room.
        kaiju:
          text: |
            In 2013 Kaiju took the stage by storm and immediately won a medal for a double IPA. Their list of awards is now quite long, which also applies to a very diverse craft-beer curriculum. Cthulhu on the Moon Black IPA, Compendium Monastic Red IPA and KRUSH! Tropical Pale Ale. Bring it on! We look forward to what they bring from 'down under' to our backyard.
        moon-dog:
          text: |
            Together with Kaiju, Moon Dog Craft Brewery is one of the pioneer new generation of craft-beer brewers of Australia. Bold combinations with exotic results characterize this brewery. The design of their branding is also worth mentioning. Score a few cans for your beer stash, because there will also be a stand with beer for take out. ðŸ˜‹
        frontaal:

            Last year these guys were there too and to everyone's pleasure these Brabo's are back! Their name says it all. Frontaal stands for straightforward quality, but no frills. This does not mean that they make boring beers. For example: we are very curious about the American Barleywine that has matured for 4 months in Tennessee bourbon barrels.

            Their beers are based on the well-known Belgian styles and contain no exotic ingredients, but are well thought out and appeal to many beer lovers. For example, their Tripel "Suver Nuver" won the first prize for Best Tripel in 2018 at the beer festival in the Martinikerk. The reason that they called their newest beer (a quadrupel) "Grutsk". In Frisian this means Proud!

          text: |
            New in Staaaaad! Obviously then you should be on the line-up of our Groninger beer festival. At De Prael, they engage in corporate social responsibility with people who are at a distance from the labor market. That is very noble, but the beers must of course be good, and they certainly are. On their C.V., among others, a Bitterblond, Scotch Ale, Barleywine, quadrupel, D.I.P.A., Milkstout and a Dortmunder.
        eggens:
          text: |
            As observers may have noticed, we have almost no breweries from Groningen on our line-up. Not out of arrogance (arrogance is strange to us), but to spawn the beer snobs. We have made an exception for Eggens. This small and charming brewery comes with their tap with fresh beers. And something special: they come with SOMETHING NEW AND WE HAVE THE FIRST TRY OUT !!! (More on that soon).
