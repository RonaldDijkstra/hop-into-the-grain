## The most surprising Craft Beer & Music Festival of the North!

It is a nice combination: hop and grain, the two unmissable ingredients in delicious beer. The amount of different beers you can create with it is endless.

For a beer lover it is important to stay up to date with the latest and tastiest brews. That's why a visit to HOP! Into the Grain Craft Beer & Music Festival is a must!

During this beer festival be surprised by the taste and quality breweries.

After last year's success, we naturally celebrate this beer festival again [at EM2](https://em2groningen.nl), the coolest and most suitable place for a Craft Beer & Music Festival! Enjoy the various beers and fine music in a relaxed atmosphere.

There is a beautiful outside area that offers space for various (food) stands, terraces and sitting areas.

Cheers and see you there the 25th of May! üçª
