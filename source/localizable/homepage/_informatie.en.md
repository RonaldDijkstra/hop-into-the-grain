The nicest and most surprising Craft Beer & Music Festival of the North!

It is a nice combination, hop and grain; two unmissable ingredients in the delicious beer. The amount of different beers you can create with it is endless.

For a beer lover, it is of course important to stay up to date with the latest and tastiest brews. A visit to Hop! Into the Grain is a must!

During this beer festival, be surprised by the taste and quality breweries.

After last year's success, we naturally celebrate this beer festival again [at EM2] (https://em2groningen.nl), the coolest and most suitable place for a Craft Beer & Music Festival! Enjoy the various beers and fine music in a relaxed atmosphere.

There is also a beautiful outside area that offers space for various (food) stands, terraces and sitting areas.

Cheers and see you there! üçª
